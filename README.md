Short Description of the Project
Title: License Plate Annotation Tool

Objective:
To annotate images with a bounding box and text representing a license plate, then save and display the annotated result.

Key Features:

Image Processing: Reads an input image and identifies the region for a license plate using predefined coordinates.
Annotation: Adds a green bounding box around the license plate and overlays the license plate number ("RAH972U") with a semi-transparent background.
Result Handling:
Saves the annotated image to a specified output file.
Displays the result in a window until the user presses a key.
Error Handling: Ensures the program gracefully handles missing or invalid input files.
Applications:

Useful for automating license plate annotations in datasets.
Can serve as a foundation for vehicle recognition or monitoring systems.
This project combines basic image processing techniques with OpenCV to demonstrate a practical application in computer vision.
